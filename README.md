# Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

Welcome to the Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System project repository! This project involves building a system that measures temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and displays the data on a 16x2 I2C LCD screen using an Arduino Uno microcontroller.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno Microcontroller
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- 16x2 I2C LCD Screen
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for coding

## Software
- **Arduino IDE**: Used to write, compile, and upload the code to the Arduino Uno board.

## Project Structure
- **Code**: Arduino code responsible for reading sensor data and displaying it on the LCD screen.
- **Project Photographs**: Images showing the setup of the components.
